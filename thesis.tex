%% ABSTRACT (200 word max, one paragraph)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
  First-order iterative algorithms are widely employed to solve large-scale optimization problems, many of which often appear in science or engineering. A relevant example of such a problem is in the field of machine learning, where huge amounts of computational power are spent optimizing model errors. Consequently, the ability to systematically compare algorithm performance across any given application to find the most efficient method can save time and energy. However, existing methods for algorithm analysis often have shortcomings ranging from the rigorousness of the result to user accessibility. In this thesis, we introduce the AlgorithmAnalysis.jl Julia package, a Lyapunov function-based framework for robust algorithm analysis accessible to a broad user base.
