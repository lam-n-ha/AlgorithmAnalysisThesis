\begin{abstract}
  JuPE is a computer program written in the Julia language that seeks to provide an accessible way of finding the worst-case performance guarantee of any gradient-based optmization algorithm in a process called \textit{algorithm analysis}. As first-order optimization methods are used to optimize large-scale problems in fields such as machine learning or data science, savings in computational capacity can be made if algorithms can be compared on their performance. JuPE by implementing the Lyapunov-based approach to algorithm analysis and creating a domain-specific compiler simplifies and automate the process of analyzing algorithms.
