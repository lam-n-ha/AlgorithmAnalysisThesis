\begin{abstract}
  Gradient-based iterative algorithms are widely used method for solving optimization problems, with well-known applications including in the fields of machine learning and data science. Savings in computational capacity can be made if the best performing algorithm is chosen for the optimization problem being solved through algorithm analysis. JuPE, the main goal of this paper, is a Julia package that aims to provide a streamlined and simple way of performing analysis on gradient descent and two of its accelerated variants at solving a class of optimization problem using an approached based on Lyapunov functions.
