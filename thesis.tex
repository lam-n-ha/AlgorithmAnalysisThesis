\begin{abstract}
  Many problems that appear in science and engineering can be considered optimization problems, and first-order iterative algorithms are used to solve large scale problems in fields such as machine learning or data science. This makes the case for the ability to compare the performance of any set of algorithms in any application to find the best performing one. Currently however, analyzing algorithms is difficult for anyone without existing knowledge of the subject, regardless of the chosen method. In this thesis paper, we demonstrate the Algorithm Analysis program, a Julia package that provides a simple and more accessible way to analyze any optimization algorithm by leveraging the Lyapunov-based analysis approach. Simultaneously, we show that by creating a language specific to the domain of optimization algorithms, the Algorithm Analysis package can serve as a platform on which different methods to perform algorithm analysis can be implemented.
