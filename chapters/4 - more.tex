To in order to perform algorithm analysis with JuPE, the user need to follow the folliowing 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Specify the class of function to be optimized.
	\item Choose an algorithm to be analyzed from a supported list or entering a new one 
	\item Specify a performance measure
  \end{enumerate}
JuPE then perform analysis automatically and return a worst-case guarantee convergence rate
